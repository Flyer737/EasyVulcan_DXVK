# EasyVulcan_DXVK
Just an install script I made to make installing nvidia drivers and vulkan on ubuntu simpler. Nothing crazy.
Should work on any ubuntu based distro, may or may not add support for debian.

# How-to

* Navigate to where the Ubuntu_nvidia-DXVK_installer.sh script

* Name the script something simpler if you desier because you're going to need to type the name of this file into a terminal later

* If you're using anything older than ubuntu LTS 20.04 then you need to comment-out or delete the line under `Ubuntu 20.04` and uncomment the line under whatever ubuntu LTS you're rockin'

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the script

Type the following:

`chmod +x ./Ubuntu_nvidia-DXVK_installer.sh` (Or whatever you named the file if you renamed it)

`sudo ./Ubuntu_nvidia-DXVK_installer.sh`

Then reboot! (`sudo reboot`)

That's it :)
Hit yes to everything. (Only take that advise if you really, deeply trust that person)

Install lutris, steam, or whatever and game!
